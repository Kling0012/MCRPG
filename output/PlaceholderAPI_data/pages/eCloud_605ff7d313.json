  "content": "PlaceholderAPI uses an expansion-cloud (A website that has all kinds of expansions stored), to download jar files, that contain the placeholders for it to use.\n\nThe expansion-cloud can be seen under https://api.extendedclip.com/home\n\nPlaceholderAPI connects to the ecloud on startup of your server, to check if the cloud is available and how many expansions are available on it. If you run /papi ecloud download <expansion>, PlaceholderAPI will connect to the site to first check if the specified expansion exists and then downloads it if it does.\n\nPlaceholderAPI can only download expansions that are verified on the eCloud. Any unverified expansion needs to be downloaded manually.\n\nYou can disable the connection to the cloud by setting cloud_enabled in the config.yml to false.\n\nYou can add your own expansion to the expansion-cloud for others to use. In order to do that, you have to follow those steps:\n\nClick on the button that says Choose an file... and select the jar of your expansion.\n\nImportant! Make sure, that the name of the jar file contains the same version like you set in the version field.\n\nClick on Submit Expansion\n\nYour expansion is now uploaded and will be reviewed by a moderator. If everything is ok will your expansion be approved and will be available on the ecloud for PlaceholderAPI*.\n\nYou can block specific expansions from being downloaded using the PAPI_BLOCKED_EXPANSIONS environment variable. Just define it with a value of comma-separated expansion names that should not be downloadable by PlaceholderAPI.\n\nThis feature exists since version 2.11.4 of PlaceholderAPI.\n\nBefore you update, please note the following: Updating your expansion will automatically make it unverified, requiring a site moderator to verify it again. This was made to combat malware from being uploaded and distributed.\n\nTo update your expansion, you first have to go to the list of your expansions. For that click on Expansions and select Your Expansions. After that, follow those steps:\n\nFill out the fields and upload the new jar.\n\nImportant! Make sure, that the name of the jar file contains the same version like you set in the version field.\n\nClick on Save Changes\n\nYour version should now be uploaded to the eCloud. You can now ask a responsible staff member on the HelpChat Discord to review your expansion to get it re-verified. Please remain patient and polite when asking.\n\nIn some cases, you may want to use a specific, older version of an expansion. Such a case could be for example, when you run an old server version and the newest version of an expansion uses methods that aren't available on that particular server version, causing compatability issues. For that case is there a way, to download a specific version of expansion. You can download the expansion either manually, or through PlaceholderAPI itself. Here is how you can do it for each.\n\nThis is the easiest of both methods since it requires the least amount of effort. Run the following command in-game or in your console to download a specific version: /papi ecloud download <expansion> [version]\n\nTo find out, what versions are available for the expansion, run /papi ecloud info <expansion>.\n\nAfter you downloaded the specific version, run /papi reload to refresh the installed expansions.\n\nTo download an expansion manually, you first have to connect to the website and go to the expansion of your choice. There, you click on the button that says Version and click on the download-icon of the version you want to download.\n\nFinally, stop your server, upload the jar to the folder in /plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions (Make sure to delete the old jar, if there's already one) and start the server again.",
