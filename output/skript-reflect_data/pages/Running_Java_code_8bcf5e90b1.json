If used as a condition, the condition will pass as long as the return value of the method is not `false`, `null`, or `0`.\n\n### Calling non-public methods\n\nIf the method you're trying to invoke is not public, you may have to prefix the method name with the declaring class in brackets. Since an object may have a non-public method with the same name in multiple superclasses, you must explicitly specify where to find the method.\n\n### Calling overloaded methods\n\nGenerally, skript-reflect can infer the correct overloaded method to call from the arguments passed at runtime. If you need to use a certain implementation of a method, you may append a comma separated list to the end of the method name surrounded in brackets.\n\n### Calling non-public fields\n\nIf the field you're trying to access is not public, you may have to prefix the field name with the declaring class in brackets. Since an object may have a non-public field with the same name in multiple superclasses, you must explicitly specify where to find the field.\n\n## Calling constructors",
