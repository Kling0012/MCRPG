  "content": "This page lists common issues you may encounter with PlaceholderAPI and how you can solve them.\n\nIf you have more questions, feel free to join the Discord Server.\n\nIf you encounter an issue such as\n\ndoes it mean that the Server you're using PlaceholderAPI on does not have Gson included. This is often the case for servers running 1.8 or older. To fix this, make sure to use at least 1.8.8 as that version does include the required dependency.\n\nIf one or multiple expansions don't work, make sure you checked the following:\n\nWhen this error appears does it mean that either getAuthor(), getIdentifier() or getVersion() in the expansion return null which is not allowed. In such a case, contact the developer of the expansion and inform them about this issue and that it should be fixed.\n\nThis error is given whenever the expansion cannot be loaded, which often happens due to a missing dependency (required plugin) or because creating an expansion instance failed.\n\nThe only thing you can do is to provide the full error so that we can check if the issue is caused by PlaceholderAPI (More unlikely) or by the expansion.",
