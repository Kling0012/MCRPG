Colors are not shown.\n\nPLAYER placeholders are used directly with a player, such as with player chat prefixes and scoreboards.\n\nRank related placeholders apply to all ranks that a player may have, and may return more than one value. Use the LADDER placeholders to control the order that is displayed. Rank based placeholder can return zero, one, or more rank related values depending upon how many ladders the player is on.\n\nMust be used directly with a player, and returns the information related to their active rank on the specified ladder.\n\nUse the ladder name, all lowercase, in place of <laddername>, and it will return zero or one rank related values.\n\nRANKS placeholders deal directly with specific rank information.\n\nUse the rank name in place of <rankname>, and may return zero or one value.\n\nRANKPLAYERS placeholders are used with players and shows what their adjusted costs are for the specified rank.

The placeholders that are supported are one for each block type that is defined in all mines.\n\nMust be used with a player. The use of <blockname> is the name of the block as provided with the command /mines block search help, but all lowercase and any \":\" should use \"-\" instead. These placeholders will return a value of 0 or more. If the block name is invalid it will return a blank.\n\nExamples: prison_player_total_blocks__cobblestone prison_player_total_blocks__customitems-compressedcobblestone\n\nThe STATSMINES placeholders represents the blocks that in the specified mine. The value nnn should be replaced with a number starting with a 1, or 001 and refers to one block. The \"line placeholder is composed of the other placeholders and can simplify the use of these placeholders.
