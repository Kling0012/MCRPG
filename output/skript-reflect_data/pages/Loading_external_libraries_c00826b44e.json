  "content": "Normally, you may only access classes loaded in the server's classpath, such as Java standard library classes, Bukkit classes, and plugin classes. If you want to use third-party libraries that are not included on the server classpath, you must load them through skript-reflect first.\n\nTo load a jar file, place it in `plugins/skript-reflect/` (create the folder if it doesn't exist).\n\nOnce an external library is loaded, its classes may be imported just like any other class.",
